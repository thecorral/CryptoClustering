# CryptoClustering

The purpose of this challenge was to apply unsupervised learning techniques to a dataset of cryptocurrency market data and predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes using the K-means algorithm.

By running K-means on the dataset, we were able to identify distinct clusters of cryptocurrencies that exhibit similar price change patterns. We also learned that the optimal number of clusters is not always straightforward, and that we can use techniques such as the elbow method and principal component analysis to help determine the optimal number of clusters. Additionally, by comparing the results of K-means using the original data versus the PCA data, we saw that using fewer features can still provide good clustering performance.
